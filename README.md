In the following webapp, different sources - Reddit, Twitter and Google Trends - are used to quickly gain an overview of current topics in the world or a specific industry/keyword. These insights can also be used by journalists, bloggers, etc. to report on topics that are currently of particular interest and most talked about. The data can also be downloaded directly as csv. The application is available through streamlit.io.  

The project was created by ["Good News Everyone"](https://github.com/svenrr/good_news_everyone) by trying out several possibilities. For this reason some of the functions can be found [there](https://share.streamlit.io/svenrr/gne-webapp-streamlit/main/main.py).
 

**WebApp:** https://share.streamlit.io/svenrr/gne-trend-analysis/main/main.py

**ToDo**: 
* Add cache function from streamlit 
* Analyze reddit & twitter comments (i.e. Sentiment Analysis with VaderScore) 
* Provide example of a trend analysis
* Implement more graphics/plots
